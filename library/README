* To generate Makefiles from a clean checkout.

- run aclocal
- run autoconf (version 2.58 or higher required)
- run automake -a 

  Once things have stabalized a bit more we'll check in 
  a configure script so that these steps can be skipped unless
  new files or projects are added.

- Create a directory for object files.  Don't run the configure
  scripts from the libs/Build directory, as that may cause problems.

- For example:
  cd $NEKTAR
  mkdir build_release
  cd build_release
  ../libs/configure 

- You can now build Nektar from this location using
  make

- Once built, "make install" will install Nektar.  By default, 
  the install files will go into a "dist" directory inside your 
  build directory.  You can modify this default through a 
  --prefix <path> command to the configure script.


* To add a new source file to a directory.
Modify local file Makefile.am to match .ccp, .h and .hpp definitions

* To add a new project

1. Create a new directory in the libs directory.
2. In your project directory, create a Makefile.am.
3. In the parent directory, add to SUBDIRS.
4. Add a reference to Makefile.am in configure.ac
5. Run automake and autoconf.
