 * A number of solvers are provided with the Nektar++ to demonstrate how to
 * use the toolkit to solve a number of common (as well as less-common)
 * problems. These include:
 * - @subpage pageADRSolver - a general solver for solving a number of linear PDE systems
 *   which are in this form using either a Continuous Galerkin or Discontinuous
 *   Galerkin approach.
 * - @subpage pageIncNavierStokesSolver - An incompressible Navier-Stokes solver.
 * - @subpage pageShallowWaterSolver - a solver for depth-integrated equations of shallow water type using either  a Continuous Galerkin or Discontinuous Galerkin approach.
 *
 * All these solvers utilise a general timestepping scheme:
 * - @subpage pageGeneralLinearMethods.
