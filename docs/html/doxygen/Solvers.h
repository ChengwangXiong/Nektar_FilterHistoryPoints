 *
 *  A number of solvers are provided with the Nektar++ to demonstrate how to
 *  use the toolkit to solve a number of common (as well as less-common)
 *  problems. These include:
 *  - AdvectionDiffusionReaction - a general solver framework for solving
 *    a number of linear PDE systems which are in this form using either a
 *    Continuous Galerkin or Discontinuous Galerkin approach.
 *  - ADR2DManifold - solves mono-domain models such as the
 *    FitzHugh-Nagumo equations or the Aliev-Panfilov model on a 2D manifold
 *    embedded in 3-space.
 *  - IncNavierStokes - An incompressible Navier-Stokes solver.
 *
 * We give a brief tutorial on configuring and using these solvers next.
 *
 * \section AdvectionDiffusionReaction solver.
 * This solves systems of equations of the form
 * \f[ \mathbf{M}\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial \mathbf{x}}
 *  = \mathbf{Lu}
 * \f]
