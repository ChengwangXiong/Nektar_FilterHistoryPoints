/** 
 * \page pageCodeStandard Coding Standards Guide
 * The purpose of this page is to detail the coding standards of the project
 * which all contributers are requested to follow.
 * 
 * This document describes the coding style standard for C++. A coding style 
 * standard defines the visual layout of source code.  Presenting source code 
 * in a uniform fashion facilitates the use of code by different developers.  
 * In addition, following a standard prevents certain types of coding errors.
 *
 * All of the items below, unless otherwise noted, are guidelines. They are 
 * recommendations about how to lay out a given block of code. Use common 
 * sense and provide comments to describe any deviation from the standard.  
 * Sometimes, violating a guideline may actually improve readability.
 * 
 * If you are working with code that does not follow the standard, bring the 
 * code up-to-date or follow the existing style.  Donâ€™t mix styles.
 * 
 * Portions of this standard associated with the use of Doxygen for automatic 
 * documentation generation or SourceSafe for configuration management may be 
 * tailored to suit the particular needs of projects that do not use these 
 * tools.  An attempt should be made, however, to adhere to the standard using 
 * similar features from other tools.
 * 
 * \section secCodeStandardDocumentation Documentation
 * - Briefs for classes, functions and types in header files using /// notation.
 * - Full documentation with implementation using /** ... *\/ notation.
 * - Use @ symbol for @class, @param, @returns, etc for ease of identification.
 * - Any separate documentation pages not directly associated with a portion of
 * the code should be in a separate file in /docs/html/doxygen.
